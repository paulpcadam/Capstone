Blossom Bank, also known as BB PLC, is a multinational financial services group that offers various services, including retail and investment banking, pension management, asset management, and payment services. This machine learning program is designed to predict online payment fraud for Blossom Bank.

## Problem 
Payment fraud is a significant issue in the online payment industry, which can cause severe financial loss to both customers and the bank. Blossom Bank wants to address this problem by building a machine learning model that can accurately predict payment fraud in real-time. This program will enable Blossom Bank to prevent payment fraud, which will not only save the bank money but also protect their customers from financial loss.

##Solution 
The machine learning program uses a supervised learning approach to predict payment fraud. The program is built using Python programming language and machine learning libraries such as pandas, and numpy. The program takes input data from Blossom Bank's online payment system, including the transaction amount, transaction type, and the customer's payment history. The program then applies machine learning algorithms to this data to predict the likelihood of payment fraud. The output of the program is a binary classification indicating whether a transaction is likely to be fraudulent or not.
